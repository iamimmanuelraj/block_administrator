## Features
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access to administrator account
- ‚úÖ Compatible with Frappe Framework
- ‚úÖ Simple setup with zero configuration
- ‚úÖ Enhanced security for email-password authentication

## Installation

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/username/block_administrator
bench --site your-site.com install-app block_administrator
```

## Usage

Once installed, the app automatically blocks login attempts to the administrator account when email-password login method is enabled. This adds an extra layer of security to your Frappe installation.

<details>
<summary>Why block the administrator account?</summary>
<br>
The administrator account has full system access. When email-password authentication is enabled, it becomes a high-value target for brute force attacks. This app helps mitigate that risk by preventing direct login to the administrator account.
</details>

## How It Works

The app hooks into Frappe's authentication system and implements the following security logic:

| Login Attempt | Result | Reason |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Administrator account | üö´ Blocked | Security risk |
| Other accounts | ‚úÖ Allowed | Normal operation |
